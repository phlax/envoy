    """Returns `exec_properties` with the RBE pool set for EngFlow x86_64 builds.

    `rbe_pool` is either a pool spec, used for every build, or a dict mapping the build's
    configuration ("asan", "msan", "tsan", "coverage": the `//bazel:<name>_build` settings; "gcc":
    the gcc toolchain; "cto", "openssl", "fuzz_coverage": those `--config`s) or "default" (any other
    build) to a pool spec; a configuration the dict does not name uses its "default" entry, and with
    none leaves in place whatever another enabled configuration pinned (fuzz coverage is also
    coverage and asan).

    A pool spec is a pool name, which applies to every action of the target, as it always has, or a
    dict with a `build` pool for its compile and link actions, a `link` pool for its link action if
    that needs a different one, and/or a `test` pool for its test action. A build pool alone leaves
    the test action on the platform default, and a test pool alone leaves the compile and link
    actions there. A link pool without a build pool leaves the compile actions on the platform
    default.

    `test` says whether the target has a test action (a `test` execution group). Without one, test
    pools are ignored. `link` says whether it is a C++ rule, whose link runs in a `cpp_link`
    execution group; only those can have a link pool.

    Memory-heavy builds are the reason to pin a pool, so prefer naming the configuration and the
    actions that need it, e.g. `rbe_pool = {"msan": {"test": "linux_x64_large"}}` or
    `rbe_pool = {"gcc": {"build": "linux_x64_medium"}}`, and a link pool where only the link needs
    more, e.g. `rbe_pool = {"coverage": {"link": "linux_x64_large"}}`, over pinning everything.
